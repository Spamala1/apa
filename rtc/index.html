			<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This document outlines various accessibility related user needs, requirements and scenarios for Real Time Communication (RTC). These user needs should drive accessibility requirements in various related specifications and the overall architecture that enables it.  These user needs, scenarios, and use cases - come from people with disabilities who use Assistive Technology (AT) and wish to see the features described available within <abbr title="Real Time Communication">RTC</abbr> enabled applications. It first introduces a definition of RTC as used throghout the document, and outlines how RTC accessibility can support the needs of people with disabilities. It then defines the term user needs as used throughout the document, and then goes on to list a range of user needs and their related requirments. Following that a range of quality related scenarios are outlined, followed by a data table that maps the user needs contained in this document to related use cases requirement found in other technical specifications.</p>

<p>This document is most explicitly not a collection of baseline requirements. It is also important to note that some of the requirements may be implemented at a system or platform level, and some may be authoring requirements.</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			                

		<h3> What is Real Time Communication (<abbr title="Real Time Communication">RTC</abbr>)? </h3>
<p>The traditional data exchange model is client to server. Real Time Communication (<abbr title="Real Time Communication">RTC</abbr>) is game-changing. It is enabled in part, by specifications like <abbr title="Web Real Time Communication">WebRTC</abbr> as this provides real-time peer to peer Audio, Video and Data exchange directly between supported web browsers without the need for browser plugins, as well as fast applications for video/audio calls, text chat, file exchange, screen sharing and gaming. However, <abbr title="Web Real Time Communication">WebRTC</abbr> is not the sole specification with responsibility to enable accessible real-time communications, as use cases and requirements are broad - as outlined in the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7478"><abbr title="Internet Engineering Task Force">IETF</abbr> RFC 7478 'Web Real-Time Communication Use Cases and Requirements'</a> document.</p>

<p>Accessible <abbr title="Real Time Communication">RTC</abbr> is enabled by a combination of technologies and specifications such as those from the Media Working Group, Web and Networks IG, Second Screen, and Web Audio Working group as well as <abbr title="Accessibility Guidelines Working Group">AGWG</abbr> and <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">ARIA</abbr>. <abbr title="Accessible Platforms Architecure Working Group">APA</abbr> hopes this work will inform how these groups meet various responsibilities for enabling <abbr title="Real Time Communication">RTC</abbr>, as well updating use cases in various groups. For example, you can view current work on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc</abbr>-nv-use-cases/"><abbr title="Web Real Time Communication">WebRTC</abbr> Next Version Use Cases First Public Working Draft.</a></p>


<section>

<h3>Real Time Communication and Accessibility </h3>
<p><abbr title="Real Time Communication">RTC</abbr> has the potential to allow improved accessibility features that will support a broad range of user needs for people with a wide range of disabilities. These needs can be met through improved audio and video quality, audio routing, captioning, improved live transcription, transfer of alternate formats such as sign-language, text-messaging / chat, real time user support, status polling.</p>
		</section>


		<section>
<h3>User needs definition</h3>
<p>This document outlines various accessibility related user needs for Accessible <abbr title="Real Time Communication">RTC</abbr>. These user needs should drive accessibility requirements for Accessible <abbr title="Real Time Communication">RTC</abbr> and its related architecture. These  come from people with disabilities who use Assistive Technology (AT) and wish to see the features described available within Accessible <abbr title="Real Time Communication">RTC</abbr> enabled applications.</p>

<p>User needs are presented with related requirements and also some in a range of scenarios; (which can be thought of as similar to User stories). User needs and requirements are being actively reviewing by <abbr title="Research Questions Task Force">RQTF</abbr>/<abbr title="Accessible Platforms Architecure Working Group">APA</abbr> in the context of the broader scope and application of the contents of this document.</p>

</ul>


</section>

<section>

	<h3>Internet Relay Chat (<abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr>) Style Interfaces required by Blind Users</h3>
		

<ul>
<li><strong>User Need 15: </strong> A blind screen reader user depending on text to speech (<abbr title="Text to Speech">TTS</abbr>) to interact with their computers and smart devices, requires the traditional Internet Relay Chat (IRC) style interface for <abbr title="Text to Speech">TTS</abbr> to translate text interactions into comprehensible speech.</li>

	  <li><strong>REQ 15a:</strong> Preserve <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> as a configuration option in agents that implement <abbr title="Web Real Time Communication">WebRTC</abbr> as opposed to having only the Real Time Text (<abbr title="Real Time Text">RTT</abbr>) type interface favoured by users who are deaf or hearing impaired.  For screen reader users, <abbr title="Text to Speech">TTS</abbr> cannot reasonably translate text into comprehensible speech unless the characters to be pronounced are transmitted in close timing to one another. Typical gaps will result in stuttering and highly unintelligible utterances from the <abbr title="Text to Speech">TTS</abbr> engine.</p>



<h4>Braille Users and <abbr title="Real Time Text">RTT</abbr></h4>

<p>Some braille users will also prefer the <abbr title="Real Time Text">RTT</abbr> model. However, braille users desiring text displayed with standard contracted braille might better be served in the manner users relying on Text to Speech (<abbr title="Text to Speech">TTS</abbr>) engines are served, by buffering the data to be transmitted until an end of line character is reached.</p>

		</section>

		<section>
<h3>Deaf users: Video resolution and Frame rates</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>User Need 15: </strong> A deaf user watching a signed broadcast needs a high quality frame rate to maintain legibility and clarity in order to understand what is being signed.</strong>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> EN 301 549 Section 6,  recommends  <abbr title="Web Real Time Communication">WebRTC</abbr> applications should support a frame rate of at least 20 frames per second (FPS). More details can be found at <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/02.01.02_60/en_301549v020102p.pdf"> Accessible Procurement standard for ICT products and services EN 301 549 (PDF)</a></p>

	<h2>Quality of Service Scenarios</h2>



<section>
	<h3>Bandwidth for audio </h3>

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A hard of hearing user needs better stereo sound so they can have a quality experience in work calls or meetings with friends or family. Transmission aspects, such as decibel range for audio needs to be of high&#45;quality. Industry allows higher audio resolution, but still mostly audio in mono only. </p>

</section>

<section>

<h3>Bandwidth for video </h3>

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A hard of hearing user needs better stereo sound so they can have a quality experience in watching HD video or having HD meeting with friends or family. Transmission aspects, such as frames per minute for video quality needs to be of high quality.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> EN 301 549 Section 6,  recommends for <abbr title="Web Real Time Communication">WebRTC</abbr> enabled conferencing and communication the application shall be able to encode and decode communication with a frequency range with an upper limit of at least 7KHz. More details can be found at <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/02.01.02_60/en_301549v020102p.pdf"> Accessible Procurement standard for ICT products and services EN 301 549 (PDF)</a></p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <abbr title="Web Real Time Communication">WebRTC</abbr> lets applications prioritise bandwidth dedicated to audio / video / data streams; there is also some <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webrtc&#45;dscp&#45;exp/">experimental work in signalling these needs to the network layer</a> as well as support for prioritising frame rate over resolution in case of congestion.</p>
